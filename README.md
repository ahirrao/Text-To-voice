# Text-To-voice
This project is a simple yet effective text-to-voice converter implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. With just a few lines of code, users can input any text they desire, and the application will generate a corresponding audio output, making it accessible for users with visual impairments or those who prefer auditory learning.
